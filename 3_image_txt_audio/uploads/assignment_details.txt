This project focuses on a comprehensive pipeline for uploading, preprocessing, and augmenting various types of data, including images, text, and audio. Users can upload their data in any of these formats, and each type goes through a customized preprocessing step designed to prepare it for further analysis or machine learning tasks. For images, preprocessing may include resizing, normalization, and color adjustments; text data is tokenized, cleaned, and structured; while audio data undergoes noise reduction and sampling adjustments.

After preprocessing, each data type is augmented to enrich the dataset and improve model robustness. Image augmentation may involve transformations like rotations, flips, or color changes; text data can be expanded through synonym replacement or paraphrasing; and audio is augmented by pitch shifting, speed adjustments, or adding background noise. This structured approach makes the project adaptable for various machine learning applications, enhancing data diversity and helping models generalize better in real-world scenarios.
